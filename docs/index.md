# Decred Developer Documentation

---

If you're looking to develop Decred-based applications, become a 
contributor, or simply gain a deeper understanding of Decred, 
this is where you'll find technical documentation such as specifications,
deeper dives into core concepts, how to set up a development environment
and guidelines for contributing.

Note that Decred's documentation is, like the project, decentralized. This
site aims to present all the documentation relevent to all projects. However
important documentation for some projects lives on GitHub, where developers
working on the project can more easily maintain it. For instance, much of the
documentation for dcrd, Decred's node daemon, lives at [dcrd/docs](https://github.com/decred/dcrd/tree/master/docs).

User documentation can be found at [docs.decred.org](https://docs.decred.org).

If you have ideas for making the developer documentation better, feel free
to [contribute](https://github.com/decred/dcrdevdocs)!
