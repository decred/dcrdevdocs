## dcrd

- [decred/dcrd](https://github.com/decred/dcrd) (Go)

dcrd is a full node implementation of Decred written in Go (golang).

It acts as a fully-validating chain daemon for the Decred cryptocurrency.
dcrd maintains the entire past transactional ledger of Decred and allows relaying
of transactions to other Decred nodes around the world.
The software was originally forked from [btcd](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd),
which is a bitcoin full node implementation that is still under active development.

## dcrwallet

- [decred/dcrwallet](https://github.com/decred/dcrwallet) (Go)

dcrwallet is the daemon that handles Decred wallet functionality for a single user.
It tracks balances across addresses, allows stakeholders to participate in Proof-of-Stake voting,
and manages all of your accounts, addresses, and transactions.

---

## dcrctl

- [decred/dcrctl](https://github.com/decred/dcrctl) (Go)

dcrctl is a command-line client for interacting with the JSON-RPC servers of
dcrd and dcrwallet.

dcrctl is not a daemon like dcrd or dcrwallet, it is an interactive tool which
calls the requested RPC method, prints the response and then terminates. It is
the primary method for CLI users to interact with their personal node and wallet.

## decrediton

- [decred/decrediton](https://github.com/decred/decrediton) (Node.js)

decrediton is a cross-platform GUI wallet for Decred built with Electron.
It operates by communicating with dcrd and dcrwallet over RPC.
It also integrates with Politeia to allow ticket holders to vote on Proposals.

## Lightning Network

- [decred/dcrlnd](https://github.com/decred/dcrlnd) (Go)
- [decred/lightning-faucet](https://github.com/decred/lightning-faucet) (Go)
- [decred/lightning-onion](https://github.com/decred/lightning-onion) (Go)

Decred’s Lightning Network implementation (dcrlnd) is based on the lnd implementation
for Bitcoin, and is under active development.
lightning-faucet provides a testnet service similar to traditional cryptocurrency faucets,
but rather than sending Decred to the user via an on-chain transaction, it will open a
payment channel with the user.
lightning-onion is a Decred implementation of the onion routing protocol used by dcrlnd.
